Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.


In this task, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover important patterns, relationships, and trends among passengers who survived and those who did not. We began by cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical data into numerical form for better analysis. After ensuring the dataset was properly formatted, we explored the general statistics and distribution of variables such as age, fare, passenger class, and survival status. By checking for missing values and understanding the dataset’s structure, we ensured that our visualizations and interpretations would be accurate and meaningful.

One of the key insights from our analysis was that gender played a crucial role in survival. Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men, likely due to the "Women and children first" rule. Additionally, passenger class had a strong impact on survival—1st-class passengers had the highest survival rate, while 3rd-class passengers faced the lowest chances of survival. We also explored the relationship between fare and survival, which showed that passengers who paid higher fares had better survival rates, suggesting that wealthier individuals (likely traveling in 1st class) had greater access to lifeboats. Age also played a role, as children had a better survival rate compared to older passengers.

To further analyze trends, we generated a correlation heatmap to see how different features were related. This visualization confirmed that fare and survival had a positive correlation, while passenger class and survival had a negative correlation, meaning that lower-class passengers had a lower survival rate. Through various plots, including bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts, we effectively visualized these relationships. This EDA process helped us gain a deeper understanding of survival factors on the Titanic, allowing us to see how social class, gender, and financial status influenced survival outcomes. Overall, the analysis highlights the importance of structured data exploration before applying any predictive models, ensuring that key variables and insights are properly understood.
